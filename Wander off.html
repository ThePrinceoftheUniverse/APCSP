<h1>The bliss of nothingness.</h1>
<p> No style. No colour. No images. No distractions. Just nothingness.
<p> It is as if it never had happened. </p>
<p> Enjoy it. </p>

<p> There is pleasure in the mundane. </p>
<p> Things that are of no importance in truth, </p>
<p> But matter in the moment. </p>
<p> Repeated tasks. </p>
<p> It's nice to just be. </p>
